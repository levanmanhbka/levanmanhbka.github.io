# 1. What is FastAPI
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+ based

# 2. About WSGI and ASGI
It is important to understand that FastAPI is an ASGI Application Framework. It cannot serve anything by itself: it needs an ASGI Server (or a WSGI server with an ASGI worker).

WSGI stands for Web Server Gateway Interface, and ASGI for Asynchronous Server Gateway interface. They both specify an interface that sits in between a web server and a Python web application or framework. WSGI has been around for a long time. ASGI is a spiritual successor to WSGI, that is able to handle asynchronous requests and responses.

In short, an (A/W)SGI Server is a web server that is able to call python code when it receives an HTTP request.

# 4. Sample of FastAPI
The simplest FastAPI file could look like this:

```python
# Content of main.py file
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}

```

Command line:
```shell
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
