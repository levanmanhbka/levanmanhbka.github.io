# 1. What is FastAPI
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+ based

# 2. About WSGI and ASGI
It is important to understand that FastAPI is an ASGI Application Framework. It cannot serve anything by itself: it needs an ASGI Server (or a WSGI server with an ASGI worker).

WSGI stands for Web Server Gateway Interface, and ASGI for Asynchronous Server Gateway interface. They both specify an interface that sits in between a web server and a Python web application or framework. WSGI has been around for a long time. ASGI is a spiritual successor to WSGI, that is able to handle asynchronous requests and responses.

In short, an (A/W)SGI Server is a web server that is able to call python code when it receives an HTTP request.

# 4. Sample of FastAPI
The simplest FastAPI file could look like this:

```python
# Content of main.py file
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}

```

Command line:
```shell
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 80 --reload
```

# 5. Files upload
![Files upload exampel](/assets/2023-12-29-FastAPI/file-architecture.png)
```python
from typing import List

from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile
from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse
from typing_extensions import Annotated

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/uploadfiles/")
async def create_upload_files(files: List[UploadFile]):
    for uploaded_file in files:
        file_location = f"{uploaded_file.filename}"
        with open(file_location, "wb+") as file_object:
            file_object.write(uploaded_file.file.read())
    return {"filenames": [file.filename for file in files]}

@app.get("/")
async def main():
    content = """
    <body>
    <form action="/uploadfiles/" enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post">
    <input name="files" type="file" multiple>
    <input type="submit">
    </form>
    </body>
        """
    return HTMLResponse(content=content)
```
